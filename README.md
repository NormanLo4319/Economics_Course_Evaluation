# Economics Course Evaluation
Evaluating students' performance in the Principles Economics courses at Diablo Valley College (DVC), San Francisco State University (SFSU), University of San Francisco (USF), and City College of San Francisco (CCSF).

# Objectives:
The objective for this project is to find any meaningful results from the survey data collected in four higher education institutions (DVC, SFSU, USF, CCSF) located in the Bay Area from the Principles of Economics courses.  By analyzing the given data sets, we would like to answer the following policy questions:

1. What determine the students' performance in the principles courses?

2. What is important to students in a principles coures?  Is technology (like online platform, digital material, etc) useful to engage students' learning?

3. How students' health is being affected by their perference on food purchase?  Does reading nutrition label help students stay healthy?

# Data: 
### Class Performance Data: 
The class performance data is the aggregated data from each class taught at different institution between 2016 spring semester and the recent semester.  It records the individual student's final grade, attendence, institution, semester, year, and the digital platform used for the class. This data is will be the key for analyzing students' performance with the given features from other data set.

### Economics Course Survey Data:
This is a voluntary survey, which distributed to students enrolled in either the Principles of Microeonomics and Macroeoncomics classes from 2016 spring until the recent semester.  The survey data contains information about students' status, their options about using the online digital tools, how they think about the course overall, etc.

### Health Survey Data:
This is a voluntary survey, which distributed to students enrolled in either the Principles of Microeonomics and Macroeoncomics classes from 2016 spring until the recent semester.  Students report their height, weight, perferences on food consumption, their family health backgroung, etc.

### Aggregation Data:
The aggregation data set is an inner-joined data set of the Class Performance, Economics Survey, and Health Survey data. The aggregate data set does not contain all the records from the three data sets. The data has been cleaned and all NAs are removed or replaced.

#### Note:
The data is collected from students voluntarily and anonymously.
